As I am still launching this website and learning what it does (and more often, does not do) I am reminded of the vast interconnectedness of programming languages.
No language can truly be learned in isolation...

Take this blog for example. In order for me to demonstrate what I learn, I need to understand how markdown will process my commands. I have to learn its basics before I can demonstrate myself learning the basics of python with in-line code. Confused yet?

At any rate, this post is really a procrastination technique for my next chapter of "Automate the Boring Stuff" on Lists. 

Here goes nothin' 


Post mortem: I just worked on python functions that can return desired parameters 1) to the exclusion of the other parameters, accomplished through an 'if-else' code block, and 2) that return statements can feature ALL possible parameters of the function. I also learned about the importance of setting defaults to your arguments when a function will be used repeatedly for the same data or object. 

Post post mortem: It turns out its very difficult to add google analytics and comments into your blog, so that will be a learning lesson. That also caused the delay in this post (the posts directory wouldn't commit because of faulty code).
