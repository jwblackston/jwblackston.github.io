J. Walker Blackston
===================

My research interests lie at the intersection of epidemiological methods, causal inference, nutrition, and cardiometabolic kidney diseases.

Additionally, I am interested in the following methodological research areas:
- Bayesian inference
- N-of-1 trials
- Machine learning for modeling -omics data
