      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Worthy punches the elevator call button as a steaming cup of Folgers sloshes onto his naked wrist. His punishment for lateness is compounded by his perception of today&amp;rsquo;s upcoming duties. As he sidles to the back corner of the elevator pod, he turns to scan the announcement board. He remains turned with each floor passing, effectively ignoring incoming passengers. He gets off at 11 and unlocks the door with his free hand. After crashing into his swivel chair, he makes way to &lt;em&gt;the binder&lt;/em&gt;. The binder holds his duties, his wants and dreams for the next 4 hours. After initially making peace with the binder, Jack runs down the list of reasons why this all sucks. He deserves better - isn&amp;rsquo;t he a little old to be doing this? He&amp;rsquo;s more than educated enough to get &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; to do it (I mean, he is a &lt;em&gt;graduate&lt;/em&gt; student after all). He was late and no one noticed! Surely he&amp;rsquo;s not that important if that&amp;rsquo;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bored with complaining, Jack made his way to the copier. He would need to unbuckle the first however-many sheets, line them up, enter his email address, ensure that the file name would reflect the purpose and genre of the sheets in transit and punch &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Start&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; He would bring a book or something to do while the machine did its thing, but it often jammed unpredictably. He realized that any more than 20 pages at a time would be a risk. Also, sheets were frequently out of order. A CRF might be mingled with a PHI, and a consent form sprinkled in the middle of MEQs or RFAs. So he developed a system of binder clips to allow for easier bindering and organizing down the line. He felt a bit dubious for thinking this &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo; would increase his productivity (what did it mean to be more productive at &lt;em&gt;scanning&lt;/em&gt;?) but the added free time was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very slowly then all at once, Jack felt calm. Succeeding at a game he created (how can he scan more records more efficiently and cleanly?), the frame of his administrative duties had flipped. He was more than accepting of its banality, he was &lt;em&gt;grateful.&lt;/em&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Worthy does not exist. He is a fictional account of my first day as a student intern in a local health clinic&amp;rsquo;s office of records. His realization of gratitude mirrors my own after reading William Irvine&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Stoic Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, Professor Irvine invokes the stoics, a set of philosophers from antiquity interested in bringing balance and tranquility to their way of life. Far from being debbie-downers, the stoics took great joy in life as they frequently visualized life &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; its most joyful components. The quick glance into a poverty of good stuff or good relationships made their reality a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irvine&amp;rsquo;s main piece of homework, the &amp;ldquo;stoic test strategy&amp;rdquo; asks that we treat each of life&amp;rsquo;s setbacks as we would an exam: how did we react to them emotionally and logistically? Only if we found a reasonable solution, and did so without anger or frustration can we call it a pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, I decided to take Irvine to task. I would test both my overall performance on the day and sprinkle in sub-tests for tasks that would be particularly trying of my patience. I thought it might help pass the time or make me seem at least &lt;em&gt;outwardly&lt;/em&gt; pleasant. I did not expect, however, for it to create an overwhelming sense of calm and gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now on the hunt to talk with anyone and everyone who&amp;rsquo;s been in my shoes. How have you taken this opportunity to do more than &amp;ldquo;get through&amp;rdquo; something? Depsite seemingly exponential progress in machine learning, I doubt AIs will be scanning, filing and redacting our old paper copy medical records in the next decade. They certainly won&amp;rsquo;t be calling participants to check on them (unless they expect to get hung up on). A significant portion of our economy still centers on administrative tasks &amp;ndash; some estimate as many as millions of people still serve to categorize, store and move information. How might adopting a stoical philosophy reframe this activity for us who think that we have &amp;ldquo;better things&amp;rdquo; to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think- How have you handled the burden of menial tasks? How would the &amp;ldquo;stoic gods&amp;rdquo; have thought you performed in doing so?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dangerous Ideas: Should you miss the max number of classes?</title>

&lt;p&gt;It is a feeling familiar to any student: You sit through lecture for an approximate eternity, pondering the infinite other ways to spend your time. Maybe you are not one to miss, let alone skip, classes that may cost hundreds of dollars per lecture. Maybe you really want to do well or even feel that you owe the professor enough respect for an hour of your attention (more of us should think this way, but that&amp;rsquo;s another topic of discussion). Regardless of your intention, your attention fades. Experiencing this myself, I asked a more global question: &lt;em&gt;what if I missed this lecture, then lectured and tested myself on the same material?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s evaluate this question empirically, because we can guess the subjective answer is a definitive &lt;em&gt;yes.&lt;/em&gt; I will make &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;three primary arguments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in favor of missing the maximum allowable lectures from your course syllabus (this is usually under the attendance heading).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAVEAT:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This argument assumes that you are in STEM-focused, technical or semi-technical classes. If lecture or discussion material are exclusively covered as they are in a non-technical class, I would not advise this strategy.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Lectures do not typically feature problem sets - which are fundamental to your success in a technical course.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevailing wisdom among scholars of learning suggests that active recall - the act of reading a question, looking away to answer, and checking your answer with the correct answer - cements deeper chunks of knowledge in our brains. This method is the most efficient for shifting knowledge from short-term and/or working memory to long-term memory. Hearing a professor describe a formula or method is one thing, but moving the pieces around with your mind is another. In fact, hearing something described can sometimes create the paradoxical effect of &amp;ldquo;display learning (term my own)&amp;quot;, where you feel the sense of familiarity with a topic overshadow the deeper intuition required to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; and reproduce it on a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Lectures can be distracting environments and hamper deeper learning of concepts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am lucky in that I have never had to endure massive lecture halls filled with hungover students infinitely swiping across their suite of social media apps. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the rare fortune of small class sizes (or favorable &amp;ldquo;student:teacher ratios&amp;rdquo; in the higher ed world) where distraction can be hemmed by social pressures. However, the modern lecture is filled with distractions, regardless of size. Next time you are in class, take stock of how many people take notes for a few minutes then flit away to whatever shinier site or app piques their interest. I personally don&amp;rsquo;t care how people choose to spend their time or money. The residual distraction for others is what bothers me. If anything, missing some lectures may come with some added mental health benefits- provided you use the time gained wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t go anywhere (and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1455509124&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=stuhac-20&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;should&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;All truly great thoughts are conceived by walking&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but my best head space is found on foot. Walking around brings an almost instantaneous shot of mental clarity that it&amp;rsquo;s surprising we have not attempted to hold lectures on the go (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you, organizational and learning psychologists..). However, I am not alone. Centuries of big thinkers attributed their success and clarity to bouts of lengthy walks. While I have my doubts on the utility of praising Nietzsche, it is true that he would actively schedule long walks to lay out arguments or treatises for his work. Einstein and Darwin are reported to have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you fail to work through your target concept, the physical and psychological refreshment will still likely improve your subsequent study. I have already 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://casual-inference.org/2020/02/03/stem-grad-school-boot-camp-week-1/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sung its praises&lt;/a&gt; in a previous post to think through why you are in school, but it may be even more effective when wrestling big lecture topics or problem sets. I even find that taking a drive by yourself with no music or podcasts can uncover similar clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Words of caution and next steps:&lt;/strong&gt; All of these arguments are testable and falsifiable. If you find that missing lectures puts you behind the 8-ball on course material, don&amp;rsquo;t do it! Also, if you don&amp;rsquo;t trust yourself to spend this time gained wisely, don&amp;rsquo;t do it! Only if you feel like you can stow away to a quiet space and push your knowledge deeply should you miss class. In a sense, you&amp;rsquo;re trusting yourself to be the professor for a class of one- do so with care and attention and you may just reap the rewards of deeper understanding and more free time.&lt;/p&gt;
